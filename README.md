*Welcome to Meteor Blaster!*<br>
another of my scratch games, this one is more complicated than my previous games.<br>
<br>
Here's how it works (if you just want to start playing there's instructions there too):<br>
1. to play, move with W A S and D. hold down the spacebar or click to shoot. The ship atomatically points toward your mouse.<br>
     (I suggest index finger on D, middle finger on W and S, ring finger on A, and thumb on the spacebar. This lets you use your right index to aim your ship.)<br>
3. There are three important stats at the top: <br>
  -Energy: the purple bar represents energy. Shooting takes it away and once it's all gone there's a cooldown while you recharge. <br>
  -Score: the number in the middle top is your score. It gets higher when you hit meteors and there's a high score feature on the title screen. <br>
  -Health: The red bar is, you guessed it, health! Hitting a meteor will hurt you more or less based on its size, however the meteor gets exploded too. <br>
4. destroying meteors gives you coins which you can spend in the shop:<br>
  -buying better ships gives you more health<br>
  -blasters increase max energy<br>
  -finally, engines make you go faster.<br>
